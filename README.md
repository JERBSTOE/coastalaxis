# How to Update Your Website with Gemini

Hi Jared! Your website is set up so you can manage it through **Google Gemini**, just like talking to a helpful assistant. You don't need to touch any code yourself.

## One-Time Setup (Do this first)

Before you start, tell Gemini it has permission to access your website files:

1. Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com)
2. Click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** at the bottom left, then **Extensions**
3. Find **GitHub** in the list and switch the toggle to **ON**
4. Follow the prompt to link your GitHub account

## How to Make Changes

Whenever you want to change something on your site, go to Gemini and use the `@GitHub` command.

**Examples you can type into Gemini:**

- `@GitHub look at my coastalaxis repo and change the main heading on index.html to "Protecting California Families & Businesses"`
- `@GitHub update the contact email in contact.html to my-new-email@coastalaxis.com`
- `@GitHub add a new paragraph to the About section in about.html that mentions my 15 years of experience`
- `@GitHub change the hero text on index.html to say "Your Trusted Insurance Partner on the Central Coast"`

## How to Make Changes Go Live

After you ask Gemini for a change, it will create a **Pull Request** (a suggested change).

1. Gemini will give you a link to the Pull Request on GitHub
2. Click that link
3. Click the green **"Merge Pull Request"** button, then **"Confirm Merge"**
4. Your website updates automatically within a couple of minutes!

## Tips

- **Be Specific:** Instead of "fix the top," say "change the header color to light blue" or "update the homepage heading to say XYZ"
- **Reference the File:** Mention which page you want changed (index.html = homepage, about.html = about page, contact.html = contact page, etc.)
- **Ask for Advice:** You can ask `@GitHub does my homepage text sound professional? What should I improve?`
- **Undo Changes:** If something looks wrong, tell Gemini: `@GitHub I didn't like that last change, please undo it`
